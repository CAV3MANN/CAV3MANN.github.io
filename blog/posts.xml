        <TEXT>Hello! This is my very first post... it also happens to be the night before a big interview so I'm going to keep this short.
        Today I flew for the fourth time in my life. I left out of Minneapolis and arrived in Kansas City. Thankfully, I do not suffer the same pain in my ears as my father does, otherwise the miracle that is flight might not seem as amazing as it always does. Anyways, once I landed I procurred the rental car, a Chevy Sonic, Garmin graciously provided for me (they are paying for my whole trip down). Utilizing a Garmin GPS (go figure) I managed to find the Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott. As usual, my room is great and very comfortable. The bed looked so comfy I almost passed out, however I needed to stay awake a bit longer so that I could find someplace that sold travel shaving cream as I wasn't able to bring my large tube of it down. I went to the local Walmart and looked around. Not finding any travel sized shaving cream, I looked for other options. That's when I found it: Luxury Shaving Soap. I have no idea how well it works, but it sounded fancy and interesting, so I bought it.
        Well, as I mentioned before I have a big interview tomorrow, so goodnight! Cheers to hoping Luxury Shaving Soap works well!</TEXT>
